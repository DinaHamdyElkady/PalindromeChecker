# Palindrome Checker in C Language

I'm thrilled to announce the completion of a Palindrome Checker project in C language! ðŸŽ‰

## Overview

This project implements a program in C that checks whether a given string is a palindrome or not. Palindromes are strings that read the same forwards and backwards.

## Features

- Efficient algorithm to determine palindrome strings.
- Utilization of string manipulation techniques.
- Implementation of error handling mechanisms for reliability.
- Thorough testing for accuracy and performance.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the `palindrome_checker.c` file using a C compiler.
3. Run the compiled executable file.
4. Input a string and observe the program's output to see if it's a palindrome.

## Example Usage

```bash
gcc palindrome_checker.c -o palindrome_checker
./palindrome_checker
